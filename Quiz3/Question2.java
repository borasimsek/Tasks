/*
 * Provide a class named die, that has to use a Random object as shown below and has two methods: 

 * one that returns the outcome for a die roll, and one that returns the last time each value appears 
 * among a given number of rolls in a HashMap. I should be able to do the following: 

Random random = new Random();
Die die = new Die(random);
int outcome = die.roll(); // outcome becomes 1,2,3,4,5, or 6.
HashMap<Integer, Integer> lasts = die.lastTime(10) 
// suppose random outcomes are 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1. 
// Then lasts HashMap would be <key:1,value:10>, <key:2,value:6>, <key:3,value:9>, <key:4,value:8>. 
Only provide the contents of the die class.
